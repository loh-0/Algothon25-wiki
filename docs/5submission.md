<!-- ### Preliminary

Your submission must include:

- Team name.
- Team captain name and email.
- Link to public GitHub repo, containing your source code in a file titled _[team_name].py._
  - This file will contain your algorithm, containing function _getMyPosition()._
  - Your function must take in the data provided in _prices.txt._
  - Your function must output a vector of integers, each denoting your daily position.

[//]: # "- 1 minute video, briefly explaining your algorithm and what strategies you employed."
[//]: # "  - Team members are not _required_ to be in the video - voiceovers will suffice."

- Any other supporting documentation and information about your non-standard libraries.

Please note that **requirements in the submission form** will precede the above information.

At case launch, we will provide our autotesting file, _eval.py_. Ensure you run your program against the test before submission. We expect algorithms to have a maximum runtime of ~10min.

Note that your algorithm will be assessed on future, unseen price data from the same trading universe.

### Finals

If your team is successful in progressing to the final round, you will be provided the data used to evaluate your algorithm in the preliminary rounds. Please make a submission with the new submission form.

Note that final round presentations will consist of a _5 minute presentation_, alongside _4 minutes_ of Q&A.

Final submissions will be also quantitatively assessed, with test results provided to judges prior to team presentation. -->
